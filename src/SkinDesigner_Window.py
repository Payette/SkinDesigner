        height: A floating point number representing the window opening height in scene units. Panel properties 'PanelWidth' and 'PanelThickness' are valid. Default value is 'PanelHeight/2'.
        fromLeft: A floating point value indicating in scene units the horizontal placement of the window from the left edge of the panel. Panel properties 'PanelWidth',  'PanelHeight' and 'C'(centered on panel) are valid. Default value is 'C'.
        fromBottom: A floating point value indicating in scene units the vertical placement of the window from the bottom edge of the panel. Panel properties 'PanelWidth', 'PanelHeight' and 'C'(centered on panel) are valid. Default value is 'C'.
        recess : A floating point value indicating in scene units the location of the glass pane relative to the front face of the wall element. Positive values place the glass pane inbound from the wall surface, negative values project the glass pane outbound. Default value is 0.0.
